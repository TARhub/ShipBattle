# ***ShipBattle***.
A game of battleship between two players.

It is currently under development.

## About the project.
**This is my first GitHub project.**
I started using GitHub because, well, it looked cool.
You will find many noob mistakes, like ~35 extra commits because I used `git rebase`, or my creating of two pointless branches that could've stayed in master.
